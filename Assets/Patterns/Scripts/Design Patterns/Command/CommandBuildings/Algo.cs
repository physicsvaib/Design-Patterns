 * Idea is we would be having a set of buildings
 * Those buildings would be spawned on player tap
 * Player gets to choose among the variety
 * On tap we get the position and we place a building block
 * When we get the command to rotate we will change the default rotation to reflect the change in 90 degree increment
 * Rotation will be changing the relative position
